# hello-world
This is my first repository on Github although not my very first one since I already made one with the help of Skillcrush. Yes, I AM a noob.
I am a skilled linguist and heavy metal drummer but thanks to the pandemic I'm not travelling the world anymore to bring joyous metal to many. Instead I sit at home, translate books and try to understand the basics of coding. Isn't this a hoot?
